          Q: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const.
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          A: var has function scope, meaning it's limited to the function it's
          declared in or is globally scoped if declared outside of any function.
          let and const have block scope, confined to the block they are defined
          in (e.g., inside loops or conditionals), making them safer and more
          predictable for variable scoping.

          Tell us the use cases of null and undefined.
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          A: null is used to explicitly represent the absence of any object
          value or as a placeholder when a value is intentionally missing.
          undefined typically represents the absence of a value or the
          uninitialized state of a variable, often automatically assigned by
          JavaScript.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">Q: What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          A: REST API is an architectural style for designing networked
          applications using a set of constraints, such as stateless
          communication, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), and standard HTTP
          methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, for creating, reading, updating,
          and deleting resources on a server. It's widely used for building web
          services and APIs.
